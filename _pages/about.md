These notes were taken from a previous iteration of an introductory course on artificial intelligence. They are based on the National University of Singapore's CS3243 course, and are compiled by Priyanka Golia, with help from students including Ang Zheng Yong, Guo Yichao, Khiew Zhi Kai, and Vincent Neo.
